# The 17 Test Categories

Every Heimdall run is a composition of independent category modules. Each category lives in `backend/src/tests/{id}/index.js` and exposes a single `run(client, depGraph, options)` function that returns an array of test results. Categories are opt-in — pick only the ones you care about for each run.

## Running a subset

Via the **Run Tests** page → deselect the ones you don't want. Or via API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/tests/run \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"categories":["dashboards","alerts","datasources"]}'
```

## Adding a new category

See the stub in `backend/src/tests/_template/index.js` and open a PR — the engine picks it up from `CATEGORIES` in `backend/src/services/testEngine.js`.
